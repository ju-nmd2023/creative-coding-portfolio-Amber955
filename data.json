    "description": "This generative artwork creates a grid of unique, human-like eyes inspired by the song “Eyes Without a Face.” It explores themes of presence and absence by reducing the human face to its most expressive feature. Written in p5.js, the code randomly varies iris colours, shapes, lashes and brows to ensure each eye is different. The system layers these elements with soft shadows on a muted background to form a living mosaic of gazes."
